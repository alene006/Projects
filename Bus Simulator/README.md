# Bus Simulation Project

This project is in effort to solve the problem of the twin cites(MN) Metro Transit bus route 3.
The bus has been experiencing complaints about the number of buses and types of buses (Express & Regular) that
have been provided lately. This project is the outcome of simulating the different types of buses needed and evaluating
what the necessary next steps are for the company.

**Project Name:** Bus Simulation <br/>  
**Author:** Estifanos Alene <br/>  
**Instruction:** Compile code on new machine and run the `BusSim.java` file <br/>  
**Overview:** <br/>  
Project contains multiple files that coorespond to different parts of the simulation. The BusSim class is the driver which runs the simulation. <br/>  
**Data Structures & Algorithms:** <br/>  
Many of the algoriths used in this project are taken from the
CSCI 1933 course which implement Queues, Linked Lists, and Arrays.
The algorithms used are fairly straight forward and have linear time complexity across the board. <br/>  
**Known bugs or issues:** <br/> In the current version, the calculation of the travel time might not reflect realtime results. Functionality overall should not be affected by the results.
