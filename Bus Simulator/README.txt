Project Name: Bus Simulation
Author: Estifanos Alene (alene006)
Instruction: Compile code on new machine and run the program
Overview: Project contains multiple files that coorespond to different parts of the simulation.
          The BusSim class is the driver which runs the simulation.
Data Structures & Algorithms: Many of the algoriths used in this project are taken from the
                              CSCI 1933 Canvas page which implement Queues, Linked Lists, and Arrays.
                              The algorithms used are fairly straight forward and have good time complexity.
Known bugs or issues: The calculation of the travel time might be off otherwise everything works fine.
