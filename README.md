Bus Simulation Project:
This project is in effort to solve the problem of the twin cites Metro Transit bus route 3.
The bus has been experiencing complaints about the number of buses and types of buses (Express & Regular) that
have been provided lately. This project is the outcome of simulating the different types of buses needed and evaluating
what the necessary next steps are for the company.
